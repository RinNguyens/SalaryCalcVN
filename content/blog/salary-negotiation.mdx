## 🎯 Tại sao cần đàm phán lương?

### Đừng để mất tiền!
- **78%** người không đàm phán khi nhận offer đầu tiên

- Tác động **lũy tiến**: Số tiền mất đi tăng theo thời gian

### Các thời điểm vàng để đàm phán
1. **Khi nhận offer mới** - Dễ nhất và hiệu quả nhất
2. **Annual review** - Dựa trên performance
3. **Khi có thêm responsibilities** - Job scope thay đổi
4. **Khi nhận offer từ công ty khác** - Leverage tốt nhất

## 📊 7 Bước đàm phán lương thành công

### Bước 1: Research thị trường (3-5 ngày trước)

**Nghiên cứu 3 nguồn:**

1. **Online Platforms**:
   - SalaryLens: Database lương lớn nhất Việt Nam
   - TopCV, VietnamWorks: Salary insights
   - LinkedIn Salary: Cho vị trí senior

2. **Network Research**:
   ```
   LinkedIn: Search "Position @Company"
   → Connect với 3-5 người cùng role
   → Inbox: "Chào bạn, mình đang tìm hiểu về salary range cho [position]. Bạn có thể chia sẻ range大概 được không?"
   ```

3. **Internal Sources**:
   - HR: Ask for salary range
   - Colleagues: Cẩn trọng nhưng hiệu quả
   - Recruitment agencies: Có data chính xác

**Template ghi chú research:**
```
Position: Senior Software Engineer
Company A: 25-35M (n=5 samples)
Company B: 22-30M (n=3 samples)
Market avg: 23.5M
My target: 25-27M
```

### Bước 2: Tính giá trị bản thân (1 ngày)

**Framework V-A-P:**

1. **Values** - Giá trị bạn tạo ra:
   ```
   - Increased revenue by X% → Revenue impact
   - Reduced costs by Y% → Cost savings
   - Improved process by Z% → Efficiency gain
   Example: "Optimized API response time from 2s to 200ms → 90% improvement"
   ```

2. **Achievements** - Thành tích cụ thể:
   ```
   Use STAR method:
   S: Situation (Bối cảnh)
   T: Task (Nhiệm vụ)
   A: Action (Hành động)
   R: Result (Kết quả)

   Example: "Led migration to microservices (T)
            using Kubernetes (A)
            reduced downtime 99% (R)"
   ```

3. **Proof** - By chứng:
   - Metrics, numbers, percentages
   - Certifications, awards
   - Testimonials, recommendations

### Bước 3: Anchor cao (Counter-offer)

**Mindset:** Aim for top 25% of range

**Phạm vi cho phép:**
- Junior: +15-20% từ offer
- Mid-level: +20-30% từ offer
- Senior/Lead: +30-50% từ offer

**Scripts tránh nói số trước:**
```
HR: "What's your expected salary?"
You: "I'm flexible and open to discuss. What's the budget for this role?"
You: "Based on the responsibilities and my experience, I'm confident we can find a fair number. What range did you have in mind?"
```

**Nếu phải nói số trước:**
```
"Based on my research and the value I'll bring, I'm looking for a package in the range of X-Y. Is this within your budget?"
```

### Bước 4: Chứng minh giá trị (During negotiation)

**Present your case:**

1. **Quantify ROI**:
   ```
   "My experience with React Native reduced development time by 40%,
    saving ~200 hours/year = ~40M in costs"
   ```

2. **Show unique skills**:
   ```
   "Certification in AWS Solution Architect (rare in Vietnam)"
   "3 years experience with fintech regulations"
   "Led team of 10 developers"
   ```

3. **Bring evidence**:
   - Portfolio của dự án thành công
   - Metrics trước/sau khi bạn join
   - Recommendations từ previous managers

### Bước 5: Đàm phán Total Package

**Đừng chỉ tập trung vào base salary!**

**Components cần đàm phán:**
```
1. Base Salary (70-80% total)
2. Performance Bonus (10-20%)
   - Target: 2-6 months
   - Measuring criteria?
   - Historical payout rate?
3. Equity/Stock Options
   - Vesting schedule
   - Strike price
   - Early exercise?
4. Benefits
   - Health insurance premium
   - Gym membership
   - Learning budget
   - Work from home stipend
5. Time off
   - Annual leave: 12-20 days
   - Sick leave
   - Personal days
```

**Template đàm phán:**
```
"I understand the base salary is fixed at this point.
Could we discuss:
- 13th month bonus guarantee?
- Additional performance bonus based on X metrics?
- $500/year learning budget for certifications?"
```

### Bước 6: Xử lý objections

**Common objections & scripts:**

1. **"We don't have budget"**
   ```
   "I understand budget constraints.
    What if we structure it as:
    - Base at current level
    - Review after 6 months based on performance
    - One-time sign-on bonus to bridge the gap"
   ```

2. **"You don't have enough experience"**
   ```
   "I understand your concern about my experience level.
    However, I've demonstrated [specific achievement]
    which directly relates to [job requirement].
    Would you be open to a 3-month probation with clear KPIs?"
   ```

3. **"This is our standard package"**
   ```
   "I appreciate the transparency about standard packages.
    Given my [unique value prop],
    is there flexibility for exceptions?
    Could we explore a performance-based adjustment after 6 months?"
   ```

### Bước 7: Có văn bản (Get it in writing)

**Checklist trước khi accept:**
```
✅ Base salary明确
✅ Bonus structure & targets
✅ Equity details (if any)
✅ Benefits breakdown
✅ Start date
✅ Probation period
✅ Notice period
✅ Working hours
✅ Remote policy
```

**Red flags cần tránh:**
- "We'll figure it out later" → RUN!
- Verbal agreements only
- Vague bonus criteria
- No clear career path

## 📜 Scripts mẫu thực tế

### Initial Offer Response
```
"Thank you for the offer! I'm excited about this opportunity.
I'd like to discuss the compensation package.
Based on my research and the responsibilities outlined,
I was expecting something in the range of X-Y.
Is there flexibility to adjust the base salary?"
```

### Counter-offer with data
```
"Thank you for sharing. After researching similar roles in the market:
- Average salary for this level: 25M
- My 5 years experience + AWS cert adds 20% premium

Given this, would you consider 27M base + 2 months guaranteed bonus?"
```

### Handling lowball offer
```
"I appreciate the offer. However, it's below my expectations and market rate.
Is 20M the final budget, or is there room for negotiation?
I'm happy to provide more examples of my value to justify a higher package."
```

### Multiple offers leverage
```
"I'm very interested in this role. I have another offer at X level.
Your company culture and the role itself are my top preference.
Would you be able to match or get closer to the other offer?"
```

### Acceptance email

"Thank you for the revised offer! I'm happy to accept the position of [Title]
with a base salary of [Amount] and [Bonus details].
I'm excited to join the team and contribute to [Company Goal].
Please send over the formal contract for my review.
Looking forward to starting on [Date]!"
