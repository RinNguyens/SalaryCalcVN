## 🎯 Framework 5 bước so sánh Job Offers

### Bước 1: Collect All Information (Template)

**Financial Information:**
```
Company A:          Company B:          Company C:
├─ Base Salary       ├─ Base Salary       ├─ Base Salary
├─ 13th month        ├─ Performance Bonus ├─ Signing Bonus
├─ Performance Bonus ├─ Commission        ├─ Stock Options
├─ Stock Options     ├─ 13th month        ├─ 13th month
├─ Signing Bonus     ├─ Signing Bonus     ├─ Relocation
└─ Relocation        └─ Benefits          └─ Benefits
```

**Non-Financial Information:**
```
├─ Job Title & Level
├─ Reporting Structure
├─ Team Size
├─ Key Responsibilities
├─ Working Hours
├─ Remote Policy
├─ Training Budget
├─ Career Path
├─ Company Culture
└─ Exit Opportunities
```

### Bước 2: Calculate Total Compensation

**Formula:**
```
Total Comp = Base + Average Bonus + Stock Value + Benefits Value
```

**Example Calculation:**

**Company A: Tech Startup**
- Base: 35M × 12 = 420M
- 13th month: 35M
- Performance bonus: 70M (2 months, realistic 80%)
- Stock: 100M (ESOP, 4 years vest)
- Benefits: 20M (health, gym, lunch)
- **Total Year 1**: 420 + 35 + 56 + 25 + 20 = **556M**

**Company B: MNC**
- Base: 45M × 13 = 585M
- Performance bonus: 90M (2 months, guaranteed)
- Stock: 150M (RSU, 4 years vest)
- Benefits: 30M (premium health, education)
- **Total Year 1**: 585 + 90 + 37.5 + 30 = **742.5M**

**Company C: Local Company**
- Base: 40M × 13 = 520M
- Performance bonus: 0
- Stock: 0
- Benefits: 10M (basic)
- **Total Year 1**: 520M

**Winner: Company B** despite lower base salary!

### Bước 3: Score Each Factor (Matrix)

**Scoring Template (1-10 scale):**

| Factor | Weight | Company A | Company B | Company C | Notes |
|--------|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------|

## ❓ Decision Making Framework

   - What skills will I have?

2. **Risk Assessment:**
   - What's the worst-case scenario?
   - Can I afford the risk?
   - What's my backup plan?

3. **Personal Priorities:**
   - What matters most right now?
   - How does this fit my lifestyle?
   - What am I willing to sacrifice?

4. **Market Conditions:**
   - How's the industry doing?
   - Are there more opportunities?
   - What if I wait 6 months?

## 🚀 Negotiation Leverage

**When to use multiple offers:**
1. **Be honest**: "I have another offer at X level"
2. **Show commitment**: "Your company is my top choice"
3. **Be reasonable**: Don't ask for impossible
4. **Have backup**: Be ready to walk away

**Sample negotiation:**
```
"Thank you for the offer of 40M. I really appreciate it.
I have another offer at 45M, but I prefer your company culture.
Is it possible to match closer to 43-44M?
I'm excited to join and contribute to [specific project]."
```
